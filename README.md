go-qbittorrent
==================

Golang wrapper for qBittorrent Web API (for versions above v4.1) forked from [superturkey650](https://github.com/superturkey650/go-qbittorrent) version (only supporting older API version)

This wrapper is based on the methods described in [qBittorrent's Official Web API](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/wiki/WebUI-API-(qBittorrent-4.1)>)

Some methods are only supported in qBittorent's latest version (v4.5 when writing).

It'll be best if you upgrade your client to a latest version.

An example can be found in main.go

Installation
============

The best way is to install with go get::

    $ go get github.com/simon-ding/go-qbittorrent/qbt
